# Inverted-Search
The Inverted Search Project is a C-based text retrieval system that efficiently searches words within a dataset by mapping them to their document locations. Using hashing and data structures like linked lists or binary search trees, the project builds an inverted index, enabling fast and scalable text lookups, similar to search engines.

Key Features:
Forward Indexing: Extracts words from documents and stores their occurrences.
Inverted Indexing: Maps words to the documents they appear in, optimizing search speed.
Efficient Searching: Uses hash tables or binary search trees for quick lookups.
Optimized Storage: Avoids redundant entries by maintaining a structured word-to-document mapping.
This project demonstrates file handling, hashing, and indexing techniques, making it valuable for search engine development and large-scale text retrieval applications.
